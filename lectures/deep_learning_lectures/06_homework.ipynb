    "Create a new convolutional module and implement it by deriving it from nn.Module.\n",
    "Then, use it in a neural network and test it in CIFAR10.\n",

    "Your creativity and the documentation are your best friends ;)\n",
    "Remember that a a layer is just a function transforming a tensor. So, I am asking you to think of\n",
    "transformation $f: \\mathcal{R}^{b \\times c_1 \\times l_1 \\times l_1} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}^{b \\times c_2 \\times l_2 \\times l_2}$.\n",

    "Don't be scared by all those superscripts. During the training, you are dealing with minibatches of images, which are\n",
    "just 4-order arrays:\n",
    "- the first dimension is the batch axis, and $b$ is the batch size;\n",
    "- the second dimension indicates the number of channels of your filters, $c$;\n",
    "- the third and fourth dimensions indicates the height and width of the input and output filters.\n",
    "They are typically the same, since we deal with square $l\\times l$ filters, but in general they could be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in our bottleneck layer we had $l_1 = l_2$ and $c_1 = c_2$.\n",
    "The bottleneck transformation preserves the tensor dimension.\n",
